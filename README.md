# Rent-a-Car

**Vision Statement**

The goal of the software, Rent-a-Car, is to provide a more efficient, effective, and user-friendly experience for customers renting a car from a rental car store, in addition to providing the business owner and staff a more efficient means of accessing customer information such as their name, phone number, age, and email address, which cars were rented and returned, and price per day. Rent-a-Car will also provide the target car rental stores with the ability to not only rent a car, but also receive returns, register customer information (i.e. first name, last name, phone number, age, and email address), track which cars are available and which cars are already rented, allow the customer to choose which class of car they desire, allow the customer to choose a desired rental date and return date, and track a daily rate for each class of car and calculate the total price of the rental based on the amount of days the car will be rented.
As described, Rent-a-Car will provide rental car stores with rich features to allow customers a more effective, efficient, and user-friendly experience renting a car from their desired car rental store as well as allow car rental stores the ability to be more efficient and productive in the rental process.
